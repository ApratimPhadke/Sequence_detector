Verilog "1011" Sequence Detector (Mealy & Moore FSM)üìñ OverviewThis repository provides a deep dive into digital logic design through a classic project: a "1011" sequence detector. It contains synthesizable Verilog code for two distinct implementations using Finite State Machines (FSMs): a Mealy machine and a Moore machine.This project serves as a practical and educational resource for students, hobbyists, and engineers who are learning or working with digital logic, FSM design, and hardware description languages (HDLs). It demonstrates how the same problem can be solved with different design philosophies, each with its own trade-offs in timing and complexity.üí° Project MotivationThis project was developed as a hands-on exercise to solidify my understanding of fundamental digital design concepts, specifically the theory and application of Finite State Machines (FSMs). While a sequence detector is a classic academic problem, implementing it from scratch in Verilog provides invaluable experience in:State-Based Logic: Translating a state diagram into synthesizable hardware description code.Design Trade-offs: Directly comparing the architectural differences between Mealy and Moore FSMs, observing their unique impacts on output timing and resource complexity.Verification and Simulation: Writing comprehensive testbenches to rigorously validate a design against various edge cases, including overlapping sequences.By building and testing both FSM types, this repository serves not only as a portfolio piece but also as a clear, practical demonstration of core digital engineering principles.‚ú® Key FeaturesDual FSM Implementations: Includes both Mealy and Moore state machine designs for comprehensive learning.Overlapping Sequence Detection: Both designs correctly identify overlapping sequences (e.g., detecting "1011" twice in the input stream 1011011).Fully Synthesizable Code: The Verilog modules are written in a synthesizable subset of the language, ready for implementation on FPGAs or ASICs.Self-Contained Testbenches: Each design is paired with a thorough testbench to verify its functionality through simulation.In-Depth Documentation: A complete guide covering theory, installation, simulation, and code explanation.üìä Simulation WaveformBelow is an example simulation waveform from the Mealy FSM testbench. Notice how the detected signal goes high as soon as the final '1' of the "1011" sequence arrives, showcasing the immediate output behavior of a Mealy machine.üß† Verilog Source Code & FSM TheoryThis section contains the complete, commented Verilog code for both FSM implementations.1. Mealy Machine ImplementationIn a Mealy machine, the output is a function of both the current state and the current input. This allows the machine to react immediately to input changes, often resulting in faster detection at the cost of potentially asynchronous output timing relative to the clock.<details><summary><strong>Click to expand Mealy FSM Verilog Code (sequence_detector_mealy.v)</strong></summary>//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
